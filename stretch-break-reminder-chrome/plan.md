## Selling Points

- Use native notifications

- Gives out stretch tips

- Intelligently stops timer when the computer goes to sleep

- only informs you of a break when you close a tab, so no nasty interruptions.

- only needs one permission, keep your data safe!

- notification removes itself after use so that there isn't a huge mess in action centre.
