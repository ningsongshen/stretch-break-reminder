# stretch-break-reminder

Reminders to take a break during long computer work periods (with stretch ideas!)

## Steps to the goal

1. Create a windows program the displays a notification
2. Make the program display the notification at a specified time.
3. Make the program display a notification at set intervals.
4. Show useful messages on the notification
5. Add a nice interface for customizations.
6. Ship on the Microsoft Store.

## Technologies

I think I will be using Google Chrome Extensions, cause Windows apps are heavy and complicated.
