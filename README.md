# stretch-break-reminder

Reminders to take a break during long computer work periods (with stretch ideas!)

## About Program

This is a chrome extension that reminds you to take a break during those busy days! Often, our minds are so focussed on a task that we simply forget to get up and take a break. A simple visual cue is sometimes all that is needed.

## Features

- Set reminder interval times
- Easy toggle on/off the reminders
- Break reminders only on tab close, so that work is not interrupted and thought process is not broken
- Simple, no-fuss interface
- Friendly messages and stretch ideas on reminder
- Doesn't clog up your notification centre with messages for every break
- coming soon: statistics page!
